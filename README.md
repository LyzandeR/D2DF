## D2DF

An R package with a set of independent functions (day to day functions) which I have found myself using more regularly.

There is no obvious connection between the functions.

The package won't be released on CRAN as these are personal functions which won't be of great interest to the community.

The package can still be installed through `devtools::install_github('Lyzander/D2DF')`.
